I am excited for this year's Hacktober Fest 2021.
Eery year it is going to be more fun and adventurous I think .I just discovered this last year and this is my second time to attend this amazing virtual event.
It is fantastic because it not only has event throughout the october month as well as makes sure we receive goodies (participants).
This is a huge opportunity for people to expand their network and also work in collaborations.
I just have many codes to pull request but here I want to return gratitude(thank you) ,by your blog and nice and easy understanding instructions I could participate last year.
